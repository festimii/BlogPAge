                <p>
                  The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical
                  computer hacker, or a computer security expert, who
                  specializes in penetration testing and in other testing
                  methodologies to ensure the security of an organization's
                  information systems. Ethical hacking is a term coined by IBM
                  meant to imply a broader category than just penetration
                  testing.Contrasted with black hat, a malicious hacker, the
                  name comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic
                  cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat
                  respectively. White-hat hackers may also work in teams called
                  "sneakers",red teams, or tiger teams.

                <p>
                  The term "grey hat", alternatively spelled as "greyhat" or
                  "gray hat", refers to a computer hacker or computer security
                  expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical
                  standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a
                  black hat hacker. The term began to be used in the late,
                  derived from the concepts of "white hat" and "black hat"
                  hackers. When a white hat hacker discovers a vulnerability,
                  they will exploit it only with permission and not divulge its
                  existence until it has been fixed, whereas the black hat will
                  illegally exploit it and/or tell others how to do so. The grey
                  hat will neither illegally exploit it, nor tell others how to
                  do so. A further difference among these types of hacker lies
                  in their methods of discovering vulnerabilities. The white hat
                  breaks into systems and networks at the request of their
                  employer or with explicit permission for the purpose of
                  determining how secure it is against hackers, whereas the
                  black hat will break into any system or network in order to
                  uncover sensitive information and for personal gain. The grey
                  hat generally has the skills and intent of the white hat but
                  will break into any system or network without permission.
                  According to one definition of a grey-hat hacker, when they
                  discover a vulnerability, instead of telling the vendor how
                  the exploit works, he or she may offer to repair it for a
                  small fee. When one successfully gains illegal access to a
                  system or network, he or she may suggest to the system
                  administrator that one of his or her friends be hired to fix
                  the problem; however, this practice has been declining due to
                  the increasing willingness of businesses to prosecute. Another
                  definition of Grey hat maintains that Grey hat hackers only
                  arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve
                  security: legality being set according to the particular
                  ramifications of any hacks they participate in. In the search
                  engine optimization (SEO) community, grey hat hackers are
                  those who manipulate web sites' search engine rankings using
                  improper or unethical means but that are not considered search
                  engine spam.

                  A black hat hacker (or black-hat hacker) is a hacker who
                  "violates computer security for little reason beyond
                  maliciousness or for personal gain". The term was coined by
                  hacker culture theorist Richard Stallman to contrast the
                  exploitative hacker with the white hat hacker who hacks
                  protectively by drawing attention to vulnerabilities in
                  computer systems that require repair.The black hat/white hat
                  terminology originates in the Western genre of popular
                  American culture, in which black and white hats denote
                  villainous and heroic cowboys respectively. Black hat hackers
                  are the stereotypically illegal hacking groups often portrayed
                  in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the
                  public fears in a computer criminal".Black hat hackers break
                  into secure networks to destroy, modify, or steal data, or to
                  make the networks unusable for authorized network users.

                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in
                  which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and
                  trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a
                  web application to send malicious code, generally in the form
                  of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that
                  allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur
                  anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the
                  output it generates without validating or encoding it. An
                  attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an
                  unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know
                  that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the
                  script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted
                  source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session
                  tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser
                  and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
                  content of the HTML page. For more details on the different
                  types of XSS flaws,
                </p>
                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>
                  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:
                  <ul><li>Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.</li>
                  <li>The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.</li></ul> 
                  <br>
                  The malicious content sent to the web browser often
                  takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also
                  include HTML, Flash, or any other type of code that the
                  browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is
                  almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
                  private data, like cookies or other session information, to
                  the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled
                  by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on
                  the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
                </p>
                <h1>Stored and Reflected XSS Attacks</h1>
                <h2>Stored XSS Attacks</h2>
                <p>Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.</p>
                <h2>Reflected XSS Attacks</h2>
                <p>Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website. When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-II XSS.</p>

                  In this section, we'll explain what SQL injection is, describe
                  some common examples, explain how to find and exploit various
                  kinds of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and summarize how to
                  prevent SQL injection.
                </p>
                <h1>What is SQL injection (SQLi)?</h1>
                <p>
                  SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an
                  attacker to interfere with the queries that an application
                  makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view
                  data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might
                  include data belonging to other users, or any other data that
                  the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an
                  attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent
                  changes to the application's content or behavior. In some
                  situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack
                  to compromise the underlying server or other back-end
                  infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.
                </p>
                <h1>
                  What is the impact of a successful SQL injection attack?
                </h1>
                <p>
                  A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized
                  access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card
                  details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data
                  breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection
                  attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines.
                  In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor
                  into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term
                  compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.
                </p>
                <h1>Retrieving hidden data</h1>
                <p>
                  Consider a shopping application that displays products in
                  different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts
                  category, their browser requests the URL:
                  https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts This
                  causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve
                  details of the relevant products from the database: SELECT *
                  FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 This
                  SQL query asks the database to return: all details (*) from
                  the products table where the category is Gifts and released is
                  1. The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products
                  that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably
                  released = 0. The application doesn't implement any defenses
                  against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an
                  attack like:
                  https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'-- This
                  results in the SQL query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE
                  category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1 The key thing here is
                  that the double-dash sequence -- is a comment indicator in
                  SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a
                  comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query,
                  so it no longer includes AND released = 1. This means that all
                  products are displayed, including unreleased products. Going
                  further, an attacker can cause the application to display all
                  the products in any category, including categories that they
                  don't know about:

                  This results in the SQL query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE
                  category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1 The modified
                  query will return all items where either the category is
                  Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. Since 1=1 is always true, the query
                  will return all items.

                  5G is next generation wireless network technology that’s
                  expected to change the way people live and work. It will be
                  faster and able to handle more connected devices than the
                  existing 4G LTE network, improvements that will enable a wave
                  of new kinds of tech products. 5G networks began rolling out
                  in the United States and around the world in 2018 and are
                  still in their early days, but experts say the potential is
                  huge.Companies are racing to have the fastest or largest 5G
                  networks. And countries are competing to be the first to
                  deploy fully functional, nationwide 5G. That’s because the
                  benefits of the new technology are expected to fuel
                  transformative new technologies, not just for consumers but
                  also for businesses, infrastructure and defense
                  applications.Much of the hype around 5G has to do with speed.
                  But there are other perks, too. 5G will have greater
                  bandwidth, meaning it can handle many more connected devices
                  than previous networks. That means no more spotty service when
                  you’re in a crowded area. And it will enable even more
                  connected devices like smart toothbrushes and self-driving
                  cars. 5G will also reduce latency — the time it takes for a
                  cell phone (or other connected device) to make a request from
                  a server and get a response — to virtually zero. And it will
                  make communication with cloud platforms (think Amazon Web
                  Services and Microsoft Azure) faster and easier.With 5G,
                  signals run over new radio frequencies, which requires
                  updating radios and other equipment on cell towers. There are
                  three different methods for building a 5G network, depending
                  on the type of assets a wireless carrier has: low-band network
                  (wide coverage area but only about 20% faster than 4G),
                  high-band network (superfast speeds but signals don’t travel
                  well and struggle to move through hard surfaces) and mid-band
                  network (balances speed and coverage). Carriers building
                  superfast 5G networks must install tons of small cell sites —
                  about the size of pizza boxes — to light poles, walls or
                  towers, often in relatively small proximity to one another.
                  For that reason, superfast networks are mostly being deployed
                  city by city. Eventually, most US carriers will have a mix of
                  the different network types that will enable both broad
                  coverage and fast speeds.The fastest 5G networks are expected
                  to be at least 10 times faster than 4G LTE, according to
                  wireless industry trade group GSMA. Some experts say they
                  could eventually be 100 times faster. That’s fast enough to
                  download a two hour movie in fewer than 10 seconds, versus
                  around 7 minutes with 4G. Actual download speeds will depend
                  on a number of factors, including location and network
                  traffic.
